# Code Verification Steps

After updating any Python code, follow these verification steps:

## ✅ Required Actions

- **Always run**: `pipenv run pre-commit run`
  - This validates code quality, formatting, and linting
  - Ensures code meets project standards before committing

## ❌ DO NOT Run

- **NEVER run automated tests** (pytest, unittest, etc.)
  - Tests are only executable on-device manually
  - Running tests in development environment will fail
  - Testing must be performed on actual hardware
