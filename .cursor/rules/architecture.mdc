# Architecture Components

## Managers
- **Pattern**: Must be Singletons accessed via `Manager.instance()`.
- **Responsibility**: Encapsulate domain logic and state.

## Controllers
- **Pattern**: Direct hardware wrappers with no business logic.

## Services
- **Pattern**: Logic providers (often network-based).
