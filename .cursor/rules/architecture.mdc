# Architecture Components

## Managers
- **Pattern**: Must be Singletons.
- **Access**: Use `Manager.instance()`.
- **Responsibility**: Encapsulate domain logic and state.

## Controllers
- **Pattern**: Direct hardware wrappers.
- **Constraint**: No business logic.

## Services
- **Pattern**: Logic providers (often network-based).

## Reference
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (System Patterns)
- `docs/PATTERNS_COOKBOOK.md` (Manager Singleton Pattern)
