Thoroughly consider the issues being raised. Allow the specifics of this conversation to dictate the depth and breadth of your research, including full codebase and project documentation review and internet searches as warranted. Provide a well-reasoned response, with supporting explanations, and a suggested path forward (or several options if that makes sense). Ask clarifying questions as needed. Make no code changes. Treat this as an ongoing discussion, until I authorize a path forward.
