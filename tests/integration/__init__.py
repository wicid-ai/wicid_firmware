Integration Tests (Device-Only)

Tests for interactions between multiple components using real hardware.
These tests run on CircuitPython devices via the REPL.

Usage (on device):
    >>> import tests
    >>> tests.run_integration()

For hardware simulation mocks (when real hardware can't be safely accessed),
use integration_mocks.py in this directory.
